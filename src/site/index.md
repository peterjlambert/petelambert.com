👋 I'm Pete Lambert; husband, father, designer, musician and keen cyclist from Yorkshire. This is where things land when they fall out of my head.

**I like the web**. I’ve been designing and building for it since 1999. I’ve lived through the browser wars and the dot-com crash. I love doing what I do. It’s a great thing, being a veteran in what’s still a nascent industry.

Since 2010 I’ve been working for [Logikcull](https://logikcull.com) as a Design Engineer (front of the front end), a designer and more recently as Design Manager. It’s a fantastic company made of fantastic people, and it gets me out of the house and over to San Francisco every so often. I like to stay flexible but really I’m an HTML/CSS specialist.

I'm a musician. [I play guitar and sing](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrV87Cz_hwZTtS1AhyjcKrVW5RwJ8O5xp), and I write songs occasionally. Since March 2020 I've been running [Lockdown Open Mic](https://lockdownopenmic.club), a virtual open mic night for the Covid generation.

I’m also a cyclist, riding road, gravel and mountain bikes. Yorkshire provides when it comes to cycling. I love a bit of snowboarding but getting to mountains is tricky. I pick up new hobbies and passions pretty easily and pretty frequently. If I’m given the opportunity to try something new I’ll usually take it.

I live in [York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York), in the North of England with my beautiful wife and our awesome teenage son.
